# Vending Machine Design Analysis & Improvements

## Design Strengths
- Well-organized component structure
- Good material variety (plywood, glass, metal)
- Proper shelving system with dividers
- Working dispensing mechanism (motors, spirals, clamps)

## What's Missing or Could Be Improved

### Critical Missing Elements

1. **Payment System** - No coin slot, card reader, or payment interface
2. **User Interface** - No keypad/number pad for product selection
3. **Display Screen** - Missing LCD/LED display to show prices and selections
4. **Product Pricing** - No visual indicators of prices
5. **Product Labels** - No label system for product identification
6. **Hinges/Opening Mechanism** - Glass front has no hinges or locking mechanism
7. **Lighting** - No internal LED strips to illuminate products
8. **Temperature Control** - No cooling system (vents, fans, refrigeration unit if needed)

### Structural/Functional Issues

9. **Door Handle** - No handle on the glass front for maintenance access
10. **Security Locks** - Missing locks for the front door and collection bin
11. **Coin Return/Change Dispenser** - No mechanism to return change
12. **Anti-theft Features** - No sensors or security elements
13. **Ventilation** - No air vents for electronics cooling
14. **Cable Management** - Wiring is visible but no cable channels/conduits
15. **Leveling Feet** - Only wheels, no adjustable feet for stability when stationary

### Design Polish

16. **Branding Area** - No space for logo/company branding
17. **Product Visibility** - Could add internal lighting for better product display
18. **Accessibility** - No consideration for wheelchair-accessible height for controls
19. **Emergency Stop** - No visible emergency power-off button
20. **Service Manual Holder** - No document holder for instructions/certifications

## Recommended Additions

### High Priority
- **Payment panel** (top-right of glass front)
- **Keypad** (below payment system)
- **Digital display** (above keypad)
- **Door hinges** (left or right side of glass)
- **Security lock** (on glass border)

### Medium Priority
- **Internal LED strips** (under each shelf)
- **Product pusher mechanism** (to move products forward)
- **Door handle** (center or side of glass)
- **Ventilation system** (if electronics require cooling)

### Nice to Have
- **Cooling vents** (sides/back if refrigeration needed)
- **Branding panel** (top front)
- **Service access documentation**
- **Anti-theft sensors**
- **Leveling feet** (for stability)
